<body>
    <p>In programming we often take something and then extend it</p>
    <p>In Javascript we have a special type of object called the prototype that is either null or references another object</p>
    <p>When we try to read a property from a prototype and its missing, Javascript automatically takes it from the prototype. This method is called prototype
        inheritance
    </p>

    <p>What is a class?</p>
    <p>
        class is an entensible program code template for creating objects providing initial values for state and implementation of the state
    </p>
    <p> A constructor gives a form to the class and therefore if a constructor is called then a particular object is invoked from a class</p>
    <p> Basically if you want to change the property of a parent class and that change can be visible in all the children, to reduce the work we use
        inheritance 
    </p>
    <p> We use entends keyword to inherit once class properties to another </p>
    <p> Method Overriding: is a method in which the methods in both the parents and child is same but the implementation is different, </p>
    <p> 
        Note the parent class will implement the main method but the child class will have a different implementation 
        and <b> will not be affected </b> to other child classes
    </p>
